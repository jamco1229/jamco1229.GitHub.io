### Problem

Through research and analysis, the problem I identified was that many existing hotel-booking apps had hidden or hard to navigate search function as well as results pages that lacked key context. This makes it harder for users to find the right stay that fits their needs and add an extra step of friction between the user and the payment screen.

### Process

To test my assumptions I made in benchmarking, I conducted usability tests on the same apps, validated some theories and debunked others. I created affinity diagrams and customer journey maps to empathise deeper with the user and analyse the data I collected. User flows, were then used to begin designing the solution. Once the happy flow was designed and documented, I created the lo-fi prototypes that focused on copywriting, and content design. I also developed a hi-fi prototype to demonstrate specific interactions that were outlined in the lo-fi one. Finally I added notes, and annotations so that it is ready to hand over with full context.

### Outcome

The outcome of this project was 2 prototypes, a lo-fi one, and a hi-fi one, the first having deep notes and annotations ready to be handed over if it was a real project. The goal of the prototype was to create an app with a straightforward search bar, an interactive map to provide context to results, and a hotel page that fits the needs of the user.

Before starting to make any assumptions it’s important to look at what the competitors are doing and the solutions they’ve found for common problems.

I looked at 3 apps, Airbnb, Secret Escapes, and Booking.com. I chose Airbnb, [booking.com](http://booking.com/) and secret escapes apps to get a wide view of the market. Airbnb is a modern take on holiday bookings, [booking.com](http://booking.com/) is popular for online travel, and secret escapes is a luxury hotel booking app for a smaller audience.

Through my analysis, I saw the value of visual hierarchy in the design. Colours can direct users to take certain actions, provide feedback on user actions, and keep the screen However, incorrect colour choices can create a chaotic screen that confuses the user and misdirects them.

For effective calls to action with a clear direction, it is best to follow airbnb’s style of using bold colours only for buttons.

I also found dark patterns, like [Booking.com](http://booking.com/)'s loss aversion, which plays into users’ fears of not being able to book, urging them to make snappy decisions by suggesting that all hotels are ‘almost’ booked up and that 10 other people are vying for the same one. [Research suggests that this leads to a negative relationship between the software and its users, and should be avoided.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/346663816_Dark_Design_Patterns_An_End-User_Perspective) An apps UX is improved with clear feedback, such as with Airbnb's animations and interaction design which feel snappy and fast, the search function is a full screen which expands out. [Booking.com](http://booking.com/) is a good example of button states and copy to indicate button actions. Both apps use FAQs, tags, and user-sourced questions to show transparency of info.

## Usability Tests

To test the assumptions that I made in my benchmarking project I needed to see users interacting with the apps to validate or disrupt them.

I was provided with 2 interviews performed by one of my tutors, as well as conducting one myself. I started by asking some questions about past use to get some insights on their own assumptions, experience, and preferences. Then I gave them a task to complete on the different apps. 

These interviews provided a great depth to **my understanding of users goals, behaviour and context** when using hotel apps that other methods of research couldn’t. This allowed me to find specific pain points or frictionless points that I may not have noticed otherwise.

## Affinity Diagrams

After collecting research on these apps I need to begin analysing my findings.

**I sorted items using logical, positive/negative interactions, and app flow.**

I started with logical sorting, grouping items by found groups like topics, screens, etc. Gave insight into common themes. Zooming out, I saw large groups around Search and page content.

The overview this gave me was great, however, I found myself questioning whether the grouping was so large because there was problems there or if it was simply largely commented on.

This lead to my second sorting method, a positive and negative grouping. Here I could quickly scan over and find the patterns that worked well (showing results on a map, images of the hotels, and clear copy) and the ones that worked against the users.

The **key issues were with search** such as visibility and access, too many options (e.g. the app shows 4 hotels in Barcelona before allowing the user to search the city), and unrelated results (marketing for other offerings).

## Customer Journey Map

![Untitled](Stay%20-%20Hotel%20Booking%20App%20(Concept)%20b0ca107d0d984ebbafa0d7d0dc1d2414/Untitled%204.png)

https://www.figma.com/file/TtvxkN2CVvkqlqqb2KjrxI/Customer-Journey-Map?node-id=0%3A1&t=A5Ci2lyOaeQmiZ06-1

From the ’flow’ sorting of my notes in the affinity diagram I felt like I could learn more by mapping the journey of the user through specific behaviours, goals, mental models, and pos/neg points. This lead to my customer journey map that **breaks down the common and key screens of each app** as well as external points of interest to fill the gaps of behaviour and collates all notes from research into the categories I just mentioned. This will become a vital resource going forward when designing each screen since it’s screen specific and clear to scan quickly.

## User Flow

![Untitled](Stay%20-%20Hotel%20Booking%20App%20(Concept)%20b0ca107d0d984ebbafa0d7d0dc1d2414/Untitled%205.png)

Here I documented the happy flow, making note of each user action and the responses the app will give.

This made me think about the specifics of how the user was interacting with the app, how I wanted the app to respond to them, and also narrow down my ideas to a specific flow, I focused on the **key problems** to solve to make this happy flow as streamlined as possible. I looked back on booking.com‘s search flow (left below) and then tried to eliminate the points that added friction. I came up with a flow (right below) that **saves 2 presses and gives accurate results** based on their needs earlier on in the flow.

## Sketches

![Untitled](Stay%20-%20Hotel%20Booking%20App%20(Concept)%20b0ca107d0d984ebbafa0d7d0dc1d2414/Untitled%207.png)

My next steps to begin designing the solution was to focus on navigation, call to actions, and layout and hierarchy.

To begin this stage of designing I sketched out each state by hand to focus on just the important problems. It also helped me to illustrate the ideas in my head in a more tangible way and work through any problems that would arise.

![Untitled](Stay%20-%20Hotel%20Booking%20App%20(Concept)%20b0ca107d0d984ebbafa0d7d0dc1d2414/Untitled%208.png)

Looking through different patterns used by other apps, utility apps (apps that have a simple and structured format with single use cases) often used floating buttons for their key action. I decided that a **large search field in the header, as well as the floating button** above the navigation tabs would be best for visibility.

Then I moved onto thinking about information hierarchy. What is the key information is that users need? This is something that had come up in the research, however, I hadn’t focused on this topic and how others are solving for it, so I went back to the apps I benchmarked at the beginning to study how they did it. Making lists of different hierarchy’s and then forming my own version. 

## Prototyping

![Untitled](Stay%20-%20Hotel%20Booking%20App%20(Concept)%20b0ca107d0d984ebbafa0d7d0dc1d2414/Untitled%209.png)

Carrying these sketches over to Figma, I used the WireFramer library by **[Tony Alssopp](https://twitter.com/tonyallsopp?s=21&t=2rsA0ldEadbWncX_NdIpzA)** to **develop the base of the prototype**. I incorporated feedback from the UXDI team and experimented with different prototyping tools (Play), ultimately deciding that Figma was the best fit for this project due to the ability to add notes and annotations directly on the canvas, if I were to hand this to a developer or brought someone else on board, then **notes putting the screens into context and showing how the app interacts with the user is important**.

You can try the final prototype here: [Figma Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/Jbb4W6cbl6Nr08cseTGC0t/Stay?node-id=174:2996&starting-point-node-id=174:2996&comments-enabled=1) and the document with annotations on the flow and other notes here: [Annotations](https://www.figma.com/file/oxrZtiIOhSOsjp2Dtoopdz/Stay---Annotations?t=SqAGNlxib6boZ0CG-6))

## Reflection & Summary

Through a process of research, analysis, and design I created a hotel booking app prototype with deep notes ready to hand over to a UI Designer and Developer, based off of the **goal of creating an app with a simple and straightforward search bar, interactive map view of the results, and a hotel page that gives the user the information they need.**

Through this process I identified problems in competitors apps and designed a lo-fi prototype to find solutions to them. Because this was a concept app worked on for my course, I don’t have any data on performance of this new app. However, if I was going to take this further I would move on to testing of this prototype with users. I would try and validate my solutions before making one final prototype to send of to a UI Designer and a Developer to carry this on.

Through the length of this project I have learnt, studied, and practiced the fundamentals of UX Design. I began this project with little practical knowledge of User Experience Design, but with a lot of excitement and dedication. I felt like a sponge soaking up everything I could in this process. I have gained the necessary skills along the way and worked hard to create a prototype that could be taken forward. I feel confident now that I have the knowledge and skills to create effective prototypes that can solve real user problems and I look forward to taking this knowledge and applying it to more products.

Problem

The problem I identified was that many existing apps had hidden or hard-to-navigate search functions and context-less search results, making it harder for users to find stays in their desired location. To address this issue, I researched existing apps and conducted usability tests to gain insights that would help inform my design solutions.

Through my analysis, I noticed the importance of visual hierarchy in the design. Colours can direct users to take certain actions, provide feedback on user actions, and keep the screen organized. However, I also noticed potential dark patterns, such as loss aversion, which can have a negative effect on the user’s experience.

Process

To test my assumptions, I performed interviews and usability tests, and then sorted my findings using logical and positive/negative interactions. I created a customer journey map to gain a deeper understanding of the user’s behaviour and collate all my research into relevant categories. I also created sketches to focus on the key problems and refine my ideas.

To create the prototype, I used the WireFramer library and Figma to develop the base of the prototype, incorporating feedback from the UXDI team. I also experimented with different prototyping tools and ultimately decided that Figma was the best fit for this project. Finally, I added notes and annotations directly on the canvas to provide more context for the user.

Outcome

The outcome of this project was a hotel booking app prototype with deep notes and annotations ready to be handed over to a UI Designer and Developer. The goal of the prototype was to create an app with a simple and straightforward search bar, an interactive map view of the results, and a hotel page that gives the user the information they need.

As this was a concept app, I don’t have any data on performance of this new app. However, if I was going to take this further I would move on to testing of this prototype with users to validate my solutions before making one final prototype to send off to a UI Designer and Developer to carry this on.
