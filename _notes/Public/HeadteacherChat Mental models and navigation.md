As part of an ongoing rebrand and restructure of headteachers.org, myself and my brother are redesigning the website from the ground up. In this mini-case study I explore our process, problems, and outcomes of redesigning a new navigation model for mobile users.

### Goal

Our goal for this project was to improve the navigational structure of [headteachers.org](http://headteachers.org) which is a resource discovery website for headteachers. Working mobile first then extrapolating that out to larger devices.

The current website is limited as it has all resources separate and hard to find, the main containers being the CMS of the edu-network (partnered companies) and the blog which had a variety of content including some blogs that had links to downloads. Currently, you would find it hard to locate any specific aspect on the website that isn’t one of the CMS Edu-Network.

### Research & Exploration

Based on the principles taught to me in the UXDI, our first task was to decide on an app type: process, utility, consumption, or commerce. We determined that it should be a blend of utility (finding specific resources) and consumption (discovery of new ones). We used data from heat maps and benchmarking of consumption apps to inform our design decisions, looking at apps like Apple TV, Spotify, Netflix, YouTube, and Disney+. We then came to the conclusion that a large CTA on a hero for search would fit the needs of the utility, and content as navigation for the consumption. We also decided on a tab-bar, similar to the apps mentioned before, however, as we developed the prototype we discovered that adding a bottom nav on top of the new safari navigation being on the bottom was too crowded and we lost the tease of continuation on the hero section. The realisation really hit home the importance of considering the device from the really early stages and understanding that we would not have the full screen benefit that the apps we benchmarked did!

### Solution

We re-strategised and found an alternative to the bottom nav that would look good on all devices. A top nav with a hamburger menu for off canvas navigation is the best solution as it allowed for much wider reach of navigation, is very space efficient, and followed a familiar pattern used in many mobile apps and web apps.

I’ll be trying to post about this regularly on here so you can follow design decisions we make on the way, and since this is still a work in progress any feedback or suggestions is very welcomed!
