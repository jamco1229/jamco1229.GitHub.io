<h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>I am a Product Designer with 3 years of experience in the film industry and 1 year at <a href="http://headteachers.org/">headteachers.org</a>. My focus is within creative collaboration, project management, prototyping, interaction design, and user research.</p>
<p>I am a co-lead for a project in my role as a product designer to build the new <a href="http://headteachers.org/">headteachers.org</a> website that serves an audience of 100k+ every month, helping headteachers find valuable resources for free.</p>
<p>I have also learnt good practices and the fundamentals of UX Design from a diploma at the UX Design Institute that I completed in December 2022.</p>
<p>I am seeking a challenging and innovative project, collaborating with a great team to create products that have an impact. I am confident that my knowledge of UX Design, experience in working at small companies, and drive can add great value to any company.

<p><strong>May 2022 — Present</strong></p>
<p><strong>Product Designer at HeadteacherChat</strong></p>
<p>Myself and the team are developing V2, a reimagining of our website that prioritises ease of use for senior leaders in finding and discovering resources and adds a more personal touch. Our users have come to know our brand through our presence on twitter and we strive to maintain that same formal, but friendly, voice on our website.</p>
<p>HeadteacherChat V2 is currently in progress and updates on the development process will be shared here.</p>
<p>Additionally, I have collaborated with print designers for the design of physical planners, ensuring a cohesive aesthetic with the new branding of V2, whilst managing the team of freelance designers and illustrators, and developing strategies for planner roll out.</p>
